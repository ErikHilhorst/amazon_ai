# Active Context: Initializing Memory Bank & Gathering Information

## 1. Current Work Focus

The "Amazon Archaeology Project Restructuring" task is now complete. The focus was on:
1.  Defining a new directory structure.
2.  Generating a plan for the user to create directories, move files, and update script paths.
3.  Executing this plan upon user request.

## 2. Recent Changes / Key Decisions

*   **Plan Generation:** A detailed markdown plan was created and presented to the user.
*   **Plan Execution:**
    *   Created the new directory structure (`old/`, `data_preparation/`, `terrain_analysis/`, `visualization/`, `research_materials/`, `input_data/`, `output_data/` and their subdirectories).
    *   Moved specified research materials (`OpenAI to Z Challenge.docx`, `paper_concept v0.5.docx`) to `research_materials/`.
    *   Moved specified input data (`ne_10m_admin_0_countries.*`, `gee_srtm_aoi.tif`) to `input_data/` and `input_data/dem/`.
    *   Moved all identified Python scripts (excluding those in `amazon_archaeology_map/`) to their new categorized directories (`data_preparation/`, `terrain_analysis/`, `visualization/`).
    *   Updated internal file path references in all moved Python scripts to reflect the new project structure and ensure they are relative to the project root.
    *   Addressed Pylance errors that arose during script modifications.
*   **Memory Bank Update:** This file and `progress.md` are being updated to reflect task completion.

## 3. Next Steps (for Cline)

1.  **Update `progress.md`:** Mark all phases of the restructuring task as complete.
2.  **Attempt Completion:** Inform the user that the restructuring has been executed.

## 4. Active Considerations

*   **User Verification:** The user should now test their scripts to ensure they run correctly from the project root and that all paths are resolved as expected.
*   **Redundant Scripts:** The user was advised that some scripts (e.g., `overlay_interfluves_map_copy.py`, and the multiple `strm_analysis*.py` files) might be redundant and could be candidates for manual cleanup or moving to the `old/` directory.
*   **Old Output Folders:** The user was advised to consider manually cleaning up old output directories once they confirm the new structure works.
*   **ChromeDriver Path:** The user was reminded that the `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH` in Selenium-using scripts is an absolute path they need to manage.
