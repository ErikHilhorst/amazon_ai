# Tech Context: Project Restructuring Plan Generation

## 1. Core Technologies Used (by Cline for this task)

*   **Markdown:** The final deliverable for the user (the restructuring plan) will be a markdown document.
*   **Python (for analysis by Cline):** To effectively categorize user's Python scripts, I will be mentally (or conceptually) parsing Python code to identify:
    *   Imported modules (e.g., `rasterio`, `whitebox`, `folium`, `ee`, `pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`).
    *   Function calls related to file I/O (e.g., `open()`, `rasterio.open()`, `pd.read_csv()`, `savefig()`).
    *   String literals that represent file paths.
*   **File System Operations (conceptual):** The plan involves `mkdir` and `mv` commands, which are standard command-line utilities. I will generate these commands as text.

## 2. Development Setup (for Cline)

*   **Access to Project Files:** I need the user to provide a list of their Python script filenames and the content of each script. The `environment_details` provides a list of files in the current working directory, which I will use as a starting point.
*   **Access to Research Material Filenames:** I need the user to provide the current filenames for their research documents (challenge description, methodological paper, bibliography).

## 3. Technical Constraints & Assumptions

*   **User's Environment:** The generated `mkdir` and `mv` commands are assumed to be compatible with a standard Unix-like shell (e.g., bash, zsh) or PowerShell on Windows, as `mv` is often aliased or available. The user's prompt specified PowerShell.
*   **Python Script Execution:** The plan assumes Python scripts will be run from the project's root directory after restructuring. All path updates will be made relative to this root.
*   **Path Identification:** Identifying file paths in scripts will rely on recognizing common I/O function calls and string literals. Complex, dynamically generated paths might be missed, but the YAGNI principle suggests focusing on common patterns.
*   **No Code Execution by Cline:** I will not execute any of the user's Python scripts. My analysis is static.
*   **No File System Modification by Cline (during planning):** I will only generate the *instructions* for the user to modify their file system. I will not directly create directories or move files myself while generating the plan.

## 4. Dependencies (for Cline's task)

*   **User Input:** My ability to generate an accurate and complete plan is critically dependent on the user providing:
    1.  A list of all relevant Python script filenames.
    2.  The full content of each of these Python scripts.
    3.  The current filenames for the "OpenAI to Z Challenge" description, the "Methodological Approach" paper, and the "Bibliography."
*   **Methodological Paper:** Understanding the workflow described in the user's methodological paper is key to correctly categorizing scripts and data types.
