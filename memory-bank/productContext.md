# Product Context: Project Restructuring Plan

## 1. Problem Solved

This "product" (the restructuring plan) addresses the common challenge of project entropy where, over time, a research or development project's file structure becomes disorganized. This leads to:
*   Difficulty in locating specific scripts or data files.
*   Confusion about which scripts are current, experimental, or deprecated.
*   Increased cognitive load when navigating the project.
*   Reduced efficiency and potential for errors when scripts rely on implicitly understood file locations.

## 2. How It Should Work

The user will receive a markdown document containing a clear, actionable plan to:
1.  **Standardize Directory Structure:** Create a predefined, logical set of folders for different categories of project assets (Python scripts, research materials, input data, output data).
2.  **Organize Files:** Move existing files into the appropriate new directories.
3.  **Maintain Functionality:** Update file path references within the Python scripts so they continue to work correctly from their new locations, assuming a consistent execution context (running scripts from the project root).

## 3. User Experience Goals

The user experience for implementing the plan should be:
*   **Clear and Unambiguous:** Instructions should be easy to follow.
*   **Step-by-Step:** The plan should be broken down into manageable phases.
*   **Safe:** Minimize the risk of breaking scripts by providing explicit path update instructions.
*   **Confidence-Inspiring:** The user should feel confident that by following the plan, their project will be better organized without loss of functionality.
*   **Empowering:** The user gains a cleaner, more maintainable project structure.

## 4. Value Proposition

The value to the user is a significantly more organized and understandable project, which will:
*   Save time in finding files.
*   Make it easier to onboard new collaborators (if any).
*   Reduce the likelihood of using outdated or incorrect script versions.
*   Provide a solid foundation for future development and maintenance.
*   Improve the overall professionalism and reproducibility of the research.
